Sample code showing Standard and MvvmCross implementation of the Navigation Drawer. Easy to implement with fragments to create a beautiful navigation scheme for your app. Also shows example of [ViewPagerIndicator](https://github.com/Cheesebaron/ViewPagerIndicator) which highlights the use of fragments inside of fragments.


**Update July 9th 2015**
Added new Design Support Library example! This is the new default implementation that you should be using!
