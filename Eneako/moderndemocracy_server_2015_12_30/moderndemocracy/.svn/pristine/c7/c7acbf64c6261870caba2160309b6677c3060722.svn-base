1,1,"Register to vote in England and Wales","The way we register to vote is changing","<p>Up to now, the head of a household has been responsible for registering everyone who lives at their address.</p><p>From 10 June, people registering to vote in England and Wales will register as individuals instead, using a new, more secure system.</p><p>You can now register to vote online in England and Wales. Scotland will follow on 19 September.</p><p><b>Registering to vote has changed</b></p><p>The voter registration system has changed and the new system is called 'Individual Electoral Registration'.</p><p>Everyone is responsible for registering themselves (Under the old system the 'head of every household' could register everyone who lived at their address). You need to provide a few more details, this makes the electoral register more secure.</p><p><b>Register to vote online</b></p><p>Fill in your name, address, date of birth and a few other details.</p><p>You'll also need your national insurance number, which is on your national insurance card, or in official paperwork such as payslips, or letters about benefits or tax credits.</p><p>Look out for a confirmation to say you're registered.</p><p><b>Electoral Commission letter</b></p><p>You'll receive a letter from the Electoral Commission between 28 July and 29 August.</p><p>Most people who are registered to vote will be registered automatically under the new system. They do not need to do anything.</p><p>Some people will need to join the new register. We are writing to people to tell them whether they need to do this.</p><p><b>Respond to the letter if you are asked to:</b></p><p>The letter will tell you whether you are on the new register or whether you need to register.</p><p>If you receive a letter confirming you are registered already on the new system you do not need to do anything.</p><p>You may need to register under the new system if you:</p><ul><li>received a letter telling you that you needed to re-register</li><li>have changed address since you received a confirmation that you were registered</li><li>did not receive a letter</li></ul>","img/news/news1_title.jpg","img/news/news1_content.png",1,"10-Dec-2014","10-Dec-2014"

We support leadership and active citizenship by helping young people make an impact on the issues they are passionate about.</p><p>The Scottish Youth Parliament is committed to supporting young people to raise their voice, understand the democratic process and understand their rights as a young person. To support this, the SYP run an outreach programme - which is available for schools, youth groups and other youth organisations.</p><p>We use our experience of participatory methods to ensure the sessions are engaging and where possible, allowing for young people to engage within democracy or enabling them to have their voice heard through community mapping exercises, consultations, etc. Each session is tailored to the specific requirements of the school and/or organisation, but to find out more information as to how the SYP can support your programme delivery please contact our offices. </p>","img/news/news2_syp.jpg","img/news/news2_sypcontent.png",1,"25-Nov-2014","25-Nov-2014"
3,1,"How can we get young people excited about elections?","Political apathy is endemic among Britain's youth.","<p>The turnout gap between the oldest and youngest in Britain is by far the largest in Europe - double that of the next nearest country. Only 32% of 18-24 year olds say they are absolutely certain to vote in the next general election (compared with 74% of those over 65).</p><p>The consequence of not voting is that you are ruled by others. So, why are young people disengaged?</p><p>The Eurobarometer survey of youth engagement showed that British and Irish young people are more likely to be engaged in action to improve their community than anyone else in Europe. Nor is it that politics is distrusted in itself: 90% of British young people - above the European average - say that voting is the right way to make political change happen.</p><p>Young people believe in politics, but they don't see voting as a civic duty, as their parents' generation did. If they don't see the benefit in voting, they won't vote.</p><p>A political party that manages to mobilise young people with policies that genuinely appeal to them could swing the next general election results in key marginals - but they won't do it until they are convinced that young people would turn out.</p><p>Despite all this, the picture is not completely hopeless. Organisations like Bite the Ballot and Rock the Union are trying to show young people that they can break the vicious circle. Youth voting in 2010 saw a small uptick from the election before, even if current polling suggests that 2015 is unlikely to maintain the trend.</p><p>Youth engagement is often patronising, assuming a triviality in young people's perspective, or that they just need to be enthused about the process. Young people in Britain are already participating, they're just not voting.</p><p>We must connect politics back to the community and social participation young people are already doing, and to a vision of the world that is optimistic and forward-looking rather than angry and reactionary.</p><p>If we do, it's not just that young people will return to the polling booths, our whole political system will benefit. That's not just a right, it's our civic duty.</p><p>Political parties have their own operations to get this information to people, but parties don't enjoy the level of trust they once did, especially among the young. Local media outlets could help here - research in Denmark has shown that turnout increases when the local media covers local elections - but these outlets are in the midst of a decline that shows no sign of being reversed.</p><p>Voters need reliable sources of information about their choices, but these are few and far between. The Electoral Commission runs the About My Vote service, but it doesn't provide information on upcoming elections until they are imminent, and even then all it provides is the election date. Councils generally produce local versions of the same.</p><p>The situation is just as bad when it comes to local election results, which are unnecessarily hard to find. The Electoral Commission does not collect any local elections results. The BBC provides only a summary of the result for a council, but no information on individual ward elections, which is technically the only local election most of us can actually vote in.</p><p>People aged 18-24 are the most mobile, least settled group in the population. About a quarter of young people aged 19 have moved between local authority areas to another in the past 12 months. The moment of their enfranchisement, when they have their first ever opportunity to vote, comes at a time when they are moving away from the community and family-based information channels they have relied on their entire lives.</p><p>The best answer is for new, online resources that will allow young people to access relevant information wherever they happen to be.</p>","img/news/news3_title.png","img/news/news3_content.png",1,"20-Nov-2014","20-Nov-2014"
4,1,"Community Councils","What are Community Councils?","<p>Community Councils are the most local tier of statutory representation in Scotland. They bridge the gap between local authorities and communities, and help to make public bodies aware of the opinions and needs of the communities they represent.</p><p>Their primary purpose is to ascertain and express the views of the community to the local authority and other public bodies. Many Community Councils also involve themselves in a wide range of other activities including fundraising, organising community events, undertaking environmental and educational projects and much more.</p><p>There are currently around 1200 Community Councils in Scotland, all of which are composed of elected volunteers from the community.</p><p><b>Community Council Short-Life Working Group</b></p><p>As part of ongoing engagement with stakeholders with an interest in strengthening and developing Community Councils across Scotland, the Scottish Government has established a short-life working group to look at ways to build the resilience and capacity of Community Councils, in order to strengthen their role as voices for their communities.</p><p><b>Community Council legislation</b></p><p>Community Councils were created by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. The Act required local authorities to introduce Community Council schemes for their area outlining various arrangements including elections, meetings, boundaries, and finance. Local authorities have statutory oversight of Community Councils and, in consultation with their Community Councils, the freedom to tailor schemes to the particular circumstances of their area.</p><p>Local authorities and other bodies consult with Community Councils on issues affecting the community. These issues depend to a large extent on what is important to each community, however, local authorities are required to consult Community Councils on planning applications and many choose to involve them in the Community Planning process.</p>","img/news/news4_title.png","img/news/news4_content.png",1,"4-Oct-2015","4-Oct-2015"
